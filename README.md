# CSharp-Edabit_Exercises
This is a project for my solutions to problems on [edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/csharp). I created an interface for others who also want to download the project and solve the problems.

# The Reason for This Project
There are great exercises on [edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/csharp). It also provides a platform for writing/testing your code and keeps a track of your progress. Unfortunately the site asks for money after a certain usage. So, instead of paying I decided to copy the questions with test cases.  I also created an interface for exercises so that any developer can clone the project and implement their own solutions.
